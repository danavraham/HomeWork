## Pizza
***



In this project I've created an order of 5 pizzas with different diameters, number of slices and number of toppings.
At the end the console prints the specified order of all the pizzas, wether the pizza is basic or not, and the total amount of toppings in the entire order.

### Classes

* **Pizza** - defines the chracters of the pizza object, Getters and Setters, Constractor and 2 methods.
1. print() -prints info of entire Pizza object.
2. isBasicPizza() -return boolean true if the pizza object has no toppings and returns false if the Pizza object has toppings .

* **Program** - main program
  creating an Arrey of Pizza called pizzaOrder and     setting the objects values.
  printing the entire Arrey info using  **print()** and if the pizza is basic using  **isBasicPizza()**.
  printing the amount of topping using a sum VAR.
